# Day 36 Assignment: Confirm app

- This day's assignment was to practice using modals in React.
- When a user logs in, they should be able to see a list of links to documents that need to be read.
 - Already read docs are faded and ones that need to be read are black
 - Once a user selects "read", the checkbox disables

This app uses Kinvey as the BAAS.
